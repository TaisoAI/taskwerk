# Implement comprehensive v2.0 architecture with YAML frontmatter

Design and implement the complete v2.0 architecture based on Fred's feedback about YAML frontmatter approach. This includes structured metadata with human-readable markdown content, enhanced task schema, and backward compatibility.

## Technical Requirements
- YAML frontmatter for structured task metadata
- Markdown content for human-readable descriptions
- Automatic migration from v1 format
- Enhanced features: dependencies, subtasks, timeline tracking, assignees
- Comprehensive validation and error handling
- Full test coverage for all new components

## Implementation Details
- **YamlTaskParser**: Handles both v1 and v2 formats with error recovery
- **TaskSchema**: Defines and validates v2 task structure
- **MigrationUtil**: Seamless v1 to v2 format conversion
- **V2TaskManager**: Enhanced task manager supporting all v2 features

# Remove confusing human vs AI mode distinction - implement unified workflow

Simplify TaskWerk's workflow by removing the confusing distinction between "human mode" and "AI mode". Implement a unified workflow that works consistently for all users while maintaining intelligent features.

## Changes Made
- Simplified workflow rules to focus on task completion quality
- Removed automatic mode detection based on environment
- Unified command behavior across all usage contexts
- Maintained AI-powered features as optional enhancements
- Updated all tests to reflect simplified behavior

## Benefits
- Clearer, more predictable user experience
- Reduced complexity in codebase
- Better documentation and onboarding
- Consistent behavior regardless of how TaskWerk is used
