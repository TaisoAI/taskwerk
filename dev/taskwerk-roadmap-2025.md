## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Modular Design**: Each major feature as a separate module
2. **API-First**: All features accessible via API
3. **Plugin System**: Allow third-party extensions
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Never break existing CLI commands

### Separate Tool Consideration
For complex orchestration features (Phases 3-5), consider creating a separate tool ("Conductor") that uses Taskwerk's API, keeping Taskwerk focused on task management while enabling advanced capabilities through composition.

### Required Infrastructure
1. **API Mode**: RESTful API server
2. **Event System**: Webhooks and real-time events
3. **Plugin Architecture**: Extension points
4. **Configuration Management**: Enhanced config system

## Success Metrics
- Task decomposition accuracy > 85%
- AI task completion rate > 70%
- Time saved vs manual execution > 50%
- User adoption rate
- Community plugin ecosystem growth

## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Complete Phase 1 (core features)
2. **Medium Priority**: Phases 2-3 (PRD-to-tasks, orchestration)
3. **Lower Priority**: Phases 4-7 (based on user feedback)

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining v0.6.x tasks (TASK-010 to TASK-022)
2. Design API architecture for future phases
3. Create proof-of-concept for task decomposition
4. Gather user feedback on orchestration approach
5. Decide on monolithic vs. separate tools architecture
