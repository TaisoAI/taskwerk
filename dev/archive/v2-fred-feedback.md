Excellent. This is a meaty document, and I like where you're headed. A tool by developers, for developers, that lives where the code lives... that's a sweet spot. Let's dive in.

---

@fred: Alright, let's put on the architect's hat. I've read through the v2.0 proposal. Overall, this is a very ambitious and well-thought-out evolution from v1. You've correctly identified the pain points of the simple system and are proposing solutions for all of them. This is a huge leap, but a necessary one to go from a personal todo list to a genuine developer workflow tool.

Here's my breakdown, section by section.

### General Philosophy & v1

@fred: **(Good!)** The core principles are solid. Human-editable markdown, git-friendly, optional AI. Don't lose this. The second you can't just `vim tasks.md` and fix a typo, you've lost the magic. The idea of a CLI API for AI assistants is particularly sharp â€“ it constrains the interaction surface and reduces token count. Very pragmatic.

@fred: **(Comment)** The `taskwerk-rules.md` file is an interesting concept. My first question is: is this just a human-readable document, or does the tool *enforce* these rules? If it's the latter (e.g., "fail pre-commit hook if no test file is associated with a 'feature' task"), that's powerful but also a significant engineering effort. Be clear about its purpose. I'd suggest starting with it as a "linting" or "warning" mechanism rather than a hard gate.

@fred: **(Good!)** You questioning the location of `.task-session.json` is a good sign. You're right to be wary. Session state is ephemeral. It absolutely **does not** belong in `tasks.md`. That would create constant merge conflicts for teams. A gitignored `.task-session.json` is the correct approach. It tracks the local user's state, not the project's state.

### Proposed Task Schema v2.0

@fred: **(Criticism/Suggestion)** This is a massive jump in complexity. My main concern is the parsing robustness. Markdown is great for humans, but a nightmare to parse consistently, especially with all this indented, semi-structured data. A single user mistake with indentation could break a task's data.

**Have you considered a hybrid format using YAML Frontmatter?** For example:

```markdown
---
id: TASK-045
created: 2025-06-29T14:30:00Z
priority: high
category: bugs
assignee: @johndoe
dependencies: [TASK-043, TASK-044]
estimated: 4h
state: in-progress
git:
  - abc123f: Fix session timeout calculation in token refresh
  - def456a: Add comprehensive session timeout tests
files:
  - src/auth/session-manager.js
  - tests/auth/session-timeout.test.js
---
- [>] **TASK-045** Fix user authentication timeout issue

**Description:**
Users are being logged out after 30 minutes of inactivity...

**Subtasks:**
...
```
This separates the structured, machine-readable metadata from the unstructured, human-readable text. It makes the parser's job 100x easier and more reliable, and it's a very common pattern (see Jekyll, Hugo, etc.). You can still edit it by hand, but it's less error-prone.

@fred: **(Good!)** The fields themselves are excellent. `Dependencies`, `Subtasks`, `Timeline`, and `Git commits` are the key features that elevate this.

@fred: **(Question/Warning)** The `Files` section is listed as "auto-tracked". This is a critical detail. **How?** Is `taskwerk` watching the filesystem? Or is it running `git status` or `git diff` when a task is completed? The latter is more robust and predictable. This "magic" needs to be clearly defined and deterministic. If it feels unpredictable, users will hate it. My suggestion: When running `taskwerk complete TASK-123`, the tool should look at `git status --porcelain`, present the modified files, and ask the user which ones belong to this task.

@fred: **(Comment)** The `Timeline` is a fantastic audit log. This **must** be automated by the CLI. If you expect a user to manually add `Started: ...`, `Paused: ...`, they won't. The commands `taskwerk start`, `taskwerk block`, `taskwerk complete` should be the *only* things that write to this section.

### Task States and Lifecycle

@fred: **(Good!)** The lifecycle is logical. Adding `[~] archived` is essential for cleaning up without losing history.

@fred: **(Critique)** In your "Example 1", the timeline includes a `Review` entry. This state isn't in your official lifecycle diagram. This is a potential source of confusion. Is `Review` a formal state, or just a note in the timeline? If you want to support a review process, it should be a first-class state, maybe `[R] in-review`. For v2, I'd suggest keeping the state machine simple and avoiding this for now unless it's a core requirement. Stick to the defined states.

### Enhanced Git Integration

@fred: **(Excellent!)** This is the killer feature set. The proposed commit message format is brilliant. It provides a perfect summary for changelogs and for other developers to understand the context of a commit. This alone would make me want to use the tool.

@fred: **(Suggestion)** For the Git Hooks, you will absolutely need a helper command like `taskwerk git-hooks install` to automate the setup. Developers can be lazy, and manually creating symlinks or copying files into `.git/hooks/` is a barrier to adoption.

@fred: **(Critique)** The `taskwerk commit --smart` command makes me nervous. "Smart" often means "unpredictable". What are the precise rules? Does it stage files from *all* completed-but-not-yet-committed tasks? What if I've completed three tasks but only want to commit one? Give the user explicit control. I'd prefer `taskwerk commit TASK-045` which stages only the files linked to that task and generates the message for it. The `--smart` flag could be an alias for committing all ready tasks, but the explicit path should be the primary one. The `--preview` flag is a great safety net.

### Enhanced Commands & File Structure

@fred: **(Good!)** The command structure (`add`, `block`, `depends`, `subtasks`, etc.) is logical and covers the new functionality well. `taskwerk tree` and `taskwerk critical-path` are fantastic additions that show you're thinking about project-level visibility.

@fred: **(Suggestion)** The `metrics/` directory is a great idea for capturing velocity and estimates. However, this data is *derived* from the source of truth (the markdown files). These JSON files should be something the tool generates on command (e.g., `taskwerk report`) and should probably be in `.gitignore`. Versioning team velocity metrics in the main branch can lead to some... interesting team dynamic discussions. Keep the primary data (the tasks) and the derived data (the reports) separate.

### Final Verdict

@fred: This is a strong, well-considered v2 architecture. You're building a tool that I would genuinely use.

**My top recommendations are:**
1.  **Seriously consider YAML Frontmatter.** It will save you a world of pain with parsing and make the system far more robust.
2.  **Define the "magic".** Be explicit about how "auto-tracking" files and "smart" commits work. Make them predictable and give the user ultimate control.
3.  **Automate everything for the user.** The timeline, git commit linking, etc., should happen as a side effect of commands, not through manual editing.
4.  **Provide helper commands.** An installer for git hooks is non-negotiable for good UX.

You're on the right track. This design moves Taskwerk from a simple note-taking app to a legitimate, lightweight Agile tool for developers who live in the terminal. Ship it.

@manu:
ok I'm kinda thinking with you on the YAML front.   I think what I would like is that the core files maintain human editability but by far the bulk of the workflow is expected to be from the taskwerk cli.  Git integration needs to come after taskwerk's workflow is completely thought out.  then it can be added as but the workflow will still be clean.  what are your thoughts.



@fred: You've hit on two critical architectural points there. That's exactly the right way to be thinking about this. Let's break it down.

### On YAML Frontmatter vs. Pure Markdown

@fred: You're right to be protective of human-editability. That's the soul of this project. But let's re-frame the YAML Frontmatter idea not as a replacement for markdown, but as a way to **protect** the human-readable parts from the machine-readable parts.

Think of it like this:
*   **The Frontmatter (`--- ... ---`) is the "header".** This is where the structured, machine-critical data lives. Things like IDs, dates, dependencies, states. Your CLI will live here. It will read and write to this section with perfect precision.
*   **The Markdown body is the "content".** This is where the human-centric stuff lives. The long description, the free-form notes, the context. This is what you'll read to get the *story* of the task.

**Why this is the best of both worlds for your goals:**

1.  **CLI-First Workflow:** You said the bulk of the workflow will be the CLI. Perfect. The CLI can be programmed to create and update the YAML Frontmatter flawlessly. `taskwerk start TASK-123` knows to find the `state:` key and change its value to `in-progress`. It's a simple, reliable text transformation. No complex regex on indented markdown lines. This makes your CLI code **simpler and more robust**.

2.  **Safe Human Edits:** This structure makes manual edits *safer*. If you want to fix a typo in the description, you just edit the markdown body. You have zero risk of accidentally breaking the task's state or dependency list with a stray space or tab. If you need to quickly change the priority, you just change `priority: high` to `priority: medium`. It's still plain text and dead simple. This is *more* human-editable than a complex, indentation-sensitive format.

Think of a `package.json` file. You mostly interact with it via `npm` or `yarn` commands, but every developer knows they can open it and manually tweak a version number. The YAML Frontmatter serves the same purpose. It's the structured manifest for the unstructured content that follows.

### On Sequencing: Workflow First, Git Second

@fred: **100% correct. This is a sign of architectural maturity.**

Building a clean, well-defined core application *before* bolting on integrations is the only sane way to do it.

1.  **Define Your Core "Noun":** Your first job is to perfect the `Task` object and its lifecycle. What does it mean to create, start, block, complete, and archive a task? The commands (`taskwerk add`, `taskwerk complete`, etc.) are the verbs that act on this noun. This is your **domain model**. It must be self-contained and work perfectly on its own. If you run `taskwerk complete TASK-123`, the state in the markdown file *must* change correctly, every single time, without any knowledge of Git.

2.  **Integrations are "Adapters":** Once your core workflow is solid, Git integration becomes a feature you build *on top* of it. It's an "adapter" that connects your stable core to an external system.

    *   The `taskwerk commit` command becomes a new verb that *uses* the information from your completed tasks. It first reads the state from the markdown files (your core domain) and then executes `git` commands.
    *   The `post-commit` hook is just a small script that calls `taskwerk link-commit <hash> --task <id>`. This is a clean separation of concerns. The Git world triggers an action in the Taskwerk world.

**The payoff is a clean, layered architecture.** Your core `Task` logic doesn't get tangled up with `git` commands. This makes it easier to test, easier to reason about, and easier to maintain. What if you want to add Jira or Slack integration later? You just add another adapter layer without touching your stable core.

### A "Day in the Life" with this Proposed Architecture:

1.  **AI/User:** "Create a task to refactor the auth service."
2.  **CLI:** `taskwerk add "Refactor auth service" --category refactor --estimate 2d`
3.  **File System:** The CLI appends a new entry to `tasks.md` with a perfect YAML Frontmatter block and a title.
4.  **You:** You `vim tasks.md` and add a detailed description and some acceptance criteria in the markdown body below the frontmatter.
5.  **You:** `taskwerk start TASK-124`
6.  **CLI:** The CLI finds `TASK-124`, changes `state: todo` to `state: in-progress` in the Frontmatter, and adds a `started:` timestamp to the `timeline:` array inside the Frontmatter.
7.  **You:** You finish the work.
8.  **CLI:** `taskwerk complete TASK-124 --files src/auth/**`
9.  **CLI:** The CLI updates the state to `completed`, adds the `completed:` timestamp, and populates the `files:` array in the Frontmatter.
10. **You:** `taskwerk commit --task TASK-124` (This is the Git integration part)
11. **CLI:** It reads the Frontmatter for TASK-124, stages the associated files, generates that beautiful commit message you designed, and runs `git commit`.

See how the core task management (steps 1-9) is completely separate from the Git workflow (step 10)? And how the CLI and manual edits work together? That's the clean workflow you're looking for.

**Your instincts are spot on. Go with the Frontmatter approach for robustness, and build your core workflow before you even think about writing the first line of Git integration code.**
